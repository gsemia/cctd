% Accept different input encodings
% Description:
%   The package translates various standard and other input encodings
%   into a ‘LaTeX internal language’.  The internal language is
%   expressed entirely in TeX's base encoding (standard ASCII
%   printable characters, carriage control tokens and TeX control
%   sequences, the latter mostly defined by LaTeX).
%   The package is part of the LaTeX distribution.
\RequirePackage [utf8] {inputenc} % for German Umlaute like äöü

% Colour control for LaTeX documents
% Description:
%   The color package provides both foreground (text, rules, etc.)
%   and background colour management; it uses the device driver
%   configuration mechanisms of the
%   graphics package to determine how to
%   control its ouptut.
%   The package is part of the LaTeX graphics bundle.
\RequirePackage [pdftex] {color}    % for coloured text

% Flexible and complete interface to document dimensions.
% Description:
%   The package provides an easy and flexible user interface to
%   customize page layout, implementing auto-centering and
%   auto-balancing mechanisms so that the users have only to give the
%   least description for the page layout.  For example, if you want
%   to set each margin 2cm without header space, what you need is just
%   \usepackage[margin=2cm,nohead]{geometry}.
%   An important feature is the package's ability to communicate the
%   paper size it's set up to the output (whether via DVI
%   \specials or via direct interaction with PDF(La)TeX).
\RequirePackage [top=30mm, bottom=30mm, left=30mm, right=25mm] {geometry}

% helvetica PS fonts with scale factor (looks better)
\RequirePackage [scaled=0.92] {helvet}

% Typeset source code listings using LaTeX
% Description:
%   Typeset programs (programming code) within LaTeX.  The source
%   code is read directly by TeX. Keywords, comments and strings can
%   be typeset using different styles (default is bold for keywords,
%   italic for comments and no special style for strings). Includes
%   support for hyperref.
\RequirePackage {listings}

% Multilingual support for Plain TeX or LaTeX
\RequirePackage[english,german]{babel}

% Publication quality tables in LaTeX
% Description:
%   The package enhances the quality of tables in LaTeX, providing
%   extra commands as well as behind-the-scenes
%   optimisation. Guidelines are given as to what constitutes a good
%   table in this context.  From version 1.61, the package offers
%   longtable compatibility.
\RequirePackage {booktabs}

% Change format of \today with commands for current time
% Description:
%   Provides various different formats for the command
%   \today, and also provides commands for displaying the
%   current time, in 12-hour, 24-hour or text format.
%   The package requires the fmtcount package.
\RequirePackage{datetime}

% Enhanced support for graphics
% Description:
%   Builds upon the graphics
%   package, providing a key-value interface for optional arguments
%   to the \includegraphics command that go far beyone what
%   the graphics package offers. For
%   extended documentation, see
%   epslatex.
\RequirePackage [pdftex] {graphicx}

% Extensive control of page headers and footers in LaTeX2e
% Description:
%   The package provides extensive facilities, both for constructing
%   headers and footers, and for controlling their use (for example,
%   at times when LaTeX would automatically change the heading style
%   in use).
\RequirePackage {fancyhdr}

% Thumbnails for pdfTeX and dvips/ps2pdf
% Description:
%   A Perl script that provides support for thumbnails in 
%   pdfTeX and dvips/ps2pdf.
%   The script uses ghostscript to
%   generate the thumbnails which get represented in a TeX readable
%   file that is read by the package thumbpdf.sty to automatically
%   include the thumbnails.  This arrangement works with both plain
%   TeX and LaTeX.
\RequirePackage{thumbpdf}         % make thumbnails in pdf

% the hyperref package loads package url
% following line sends options to package 
\PassOptionsToPackage{hyphens}{url}

% Extensive support for hypertext in LaTeX
% Description:
%   The hyperref package is used to handle cross-referencing
%   commands in LaTeX to produce hypertext links in the document.
%   The package provides backends for the \special set
%   defined for HyperTeX DVI processors; for embedded
%   pdfmark commands for processing by Acrobat Distiller
%   (dvips and Y's dvipsone); for
%   Y's dviwindo; for PDF control within pdfTeX and
%   dvipdfm; for TeX4ht; and for VTeX's pdf and HTML
%   backends.
%   The package is distributed with the backref and
%   nameref packages, which make use of the facilities
%   of hyperref.
%   The package depends on the author's kvoptions and
%   refcount packages.
%   the hyperref package must be the last package called
\RequirePackage[pdftex,hyperindex,backref]{hyperref}

% Conditional commands in LaTeX documents
% Description:
%   The package's basic command is \ifthenelse, which can use
%   a wide array of tests.  Also provided is a simple loop command
%   \whiledo.
%   The package is part of the LaTeX distribution.
\RequirePackage{ifthen}

% Draw "watermarks" on the output page
% Description:
%   The package implements watermarks using a LaTeX picture
%   environment that is drawn under the body of the page.  Watermarks
%   for left and right pages, and for a single page only, may be
%   specified.
%   The package is part of the ncctools bundle.
\usepackage{watermark}

% LaTeX support for the Text Companion fonts.
% Description:
%   Supports the Text Companion fonts which provide many text
%  symbols (such as baht, bullet, copyright, musicalnote,
%  onequarter, section, and yen) in the TS1 encoding.
%\usepackage {textcomp} % go for trademarksymbol and for the Celsius Degree

% This package reimplements the LATEX verbatim and verbatim* environments.
% In addition it provides a comment environment that skips any
% commands or text between \begin{comment} and the next \end{comment}.
% It also defines the command verbatiminput to input a whole file verbatim.
%\usepackage {verbatim}

% Figures broken into subfigures
% Description:
%   The package provides support for the manipulation and reference of
%   small or ‘sub’ figures and tables within a single
%   figure or table environment. It is convenient to use this package
%   when your subfigures are to be separately captioned, referenced,
%   or are to be included in the List-of-Figures. A new
%   \subfigure command is introduced which can be used inside a
%   figure environment for each subfigure. An optional first
%   argument is used as the caption for that subfigure.
%
%   This package supersedes the
%   subfigure package (which will
%   continue to be supported, but no longer maintained).  The name has
%   changed because the subfig package is not completely backward
%   compatible with the older subfigure package due to an extensive
%   rewrite to use the new caption
%   package to produce its subcaptions.  The major advantage to the
%   new package is that the user interface is keyword/value driven and
%   easier to use.  To ease the transition from the subfigure package
%   it includes a configuration file (subfig.cfg) which nearly
%   emulates the subfigure package.
\RequirePackage{subfig}

% Create illustrations for network protocol specifications.
% Description:
% The bytefield package helps the user create illustrations for
% network protocol specifications and anything else that utilizes
% fields of data.  These illustrations show how the bits and bytes
% are laid out in a packet or in memory.
\usepackage {bytefield}

% Produces figures which text can flow around.
% Description:
%   Allows figures to have text wrapped around them.  Does not work
%   in combination with list environments, but can be used in a
%   parbox or minipage, and in twocolumn format. Supports the float
%   package.
%
%   Note that most of the package documentation is contained in
%   wrapfig.sty itself (after the \endinput command at the
%   end of the package proper).
